## What is a distributed ledger?

The most fundamental explanation of a blockchain is that it's a globally synchronised clock that enables the recording of events on what's known as a `distributed ledger`.

The tricky thing about recording timestamped events over a network is that times both asynchronus and relative; clocks drift from each other based on their distance and speed of travel and thus do computers. Traditionally we bypass the issue by referencing centralised standards bodies like <tip content="United Nations Statistical Office">UNSO</tip> and <tip content="National Institute of Standards and Technology">NIST</tip> who then act as the source.

Blockchain is unique in that it invents it's own standard known as `block time` (aka `block height`). This measurement however is simply a result of network activity and so let's look at the combined topics of `block creation`, `consensus mechanisms` and `token incentives`.
