# Cosmo Genesis

![](/assets/cosmogenesis.png)

Welcome! You have made it to our training lab on the moon; an observation site for cosmic ecologists. As you explore, you'll find resources and transmissions that can aid you in your comparative studies and praxis based learning. The truely perceptive may even find some easter eggs around!

## Pioneer Quick Start

On this website, you'll find a series of guides primarily intended to help initiate everyday cosmonaughts into the boundry undefined worlds of autonomous organising, deep tech and computer science.

This initial transmission intends to make onboarding into any autonomous emancipatory space as easy as possible, while also serving as a map or beacon for those potentially lost in space.

Beyond that the observation lab hopes it's comparative resources will be informative enough for seekers attempting to make sense of the cosmos within and without for themselves.

## Autonomous Onboarding

The following transmission should be general enough for self-onboarding into any existing organisation or for the purposes of bootstrapping a fresh cosmos within the Noosphere II. Slight tweaks may be necessary or desirable depending on your own specific context. Good luck with lift off!

1. Set up general communications and articulating other tools needed while ensuring permissions are granted. Look ahead to culture and review stages.

2. Introductions to other participants should come next, making first impressions while seeking a niche role. Look ahead to the cultural process and action stages.

3. Learn about the cultural process; typically how meetings get turned into useful artefacts, reporting and note taking is an easy first step in finding tracktion. Look back to initial setup and introductory stages for guidance.

4. Hold the vision and purpose as you fall into discovery mode; thinking about needs in context of an environment to create useful solutions is a good mentality - dance in the void!

5. Describe and document the artifact under production; a wiki with models and tables or governance tool might be useful. Look ahead to review and action stages.

6. Review the artifact with a partner while considering the acceptance criteria and specifying your needs for the next coming cycle.

7. Take action based on the reviewed artifact while keeping in mind the collaborators needed to complete the task, you'll probably want to work with at least three.

## System Viability

Great, now the ball's rolling, let's ask some important questions lest our group get carried away by the cosmic gales. Let's consider the wider context of our activites through the lens of a viable systems model:

1. What is the aligning source and purpose that drives activity? Pioneers should query their cosmologies and contemplate essential questions or spiritual callings!
2. What information and intelligence do we need to make sense of trends and horizons in the living world?
3. What operations support autonomy for everyone?
4. What tasks are there to coordinate around?
5. What resources are needed to sustain activity?

Beyond these example questions, the diagram above can be used to ask more targeted and meaningful questions!

You may also use the model generativly as a sort of systems diagnostics. Asking what the nodes might be in your own context is useful for wrangling narrative hypergraphs, while contemplating what the links represent can exceptionally generative!
