# Distributed Applications

From a political or governance perspective the dynamics of a distributed application revolves around `People` (or agents) agreeing on `Paramaters` (or purpose) and the `Rules` for authoring changes.

From the functional perspective of a distributed application residing within the computational cosmos, the dynamics of distributed applications can be thought of as <tip content="Hardware such as phone, wearables and web UIs">`human interfaces`</tip>, <tip content="Autonomous code like AI agents, digital twins, smart contracts">`programatic interfaces`</tip> and <tip content ="Embedding environments with attributes like data integrity, provinence tracking and origination">`network interfaces`</tip>.

### Programmatic Interfaces

In Web3 these are smart contracts; autonomous code running within a virtual machine. These pieces of back end code running in a virtual machine take various forms. Generally speaking their primary use cases should be centered around token engineering and crypto economics. The primary question should be along the lines of "why does decentralisation matter?"

There are a few primitives to note:

- Curation
  - Token Curated Registries
  - Token Gated Communities
  - Prediction markets
  - Meme markets
- Voting
  - Quadratic voting
  - Liquid democracy
  - Futurarchy
- Arbitration
  - Third party dispute resolution
  - Bonding curves
- Taxes
  - Harberger taxes
  - Tributes / burns
