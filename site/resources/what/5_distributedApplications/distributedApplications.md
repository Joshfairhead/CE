From a political or governance perspective the dynamics of a distributed application revolves around `People` (or agents) agreeing on `Paramaters` (or purpose) and the `Rules` for authoring changes.

From a functional perspective of distributed applications residing within the computational cosmos, the dynamics can be thought of as <tip content="Hardware such as phone, wearables and web UIs">`human interfaces`</tip>, <tip content="Autonomous code like AI agents, digital twins, smart contracts">`programatic interfaces`</tip> and <tip content ="Embedding environments with attributes like data integrity, provinence tracking and origination">`network interfaces`</tip>.
