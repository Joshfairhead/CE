# Launch Pad

This series of guides focuses on those unfamiliar with technological environments and ecosystems. The intention is to make onboarding easy for those getting involved in spaces with undefined boundaries. We will need some tools for navigation...

## Onboarding

The following instruction set is general enough to be used for onboarding participants into an existing organisation or for bootstrapping a fresh membrane.

1. Begin setup with communication to articulate the tools used and grant permissions, Look ahead to process and review

2. Introductions should come next, making first impressions and developing a role. Look ahead to Process and action

3. Learn about the culture, typically how meetings get turned into useful artefacts; reporting is a first step. Look back to setup and people

4. Hold the vision and purpose; usually thinking about needs in context of an environment to create solutions

5. Describe what you have been doing in a wiki with models and tables while looking ahead to review and action

6. Review documentation with a partner looking acceptance criteria and specify the needs of the next cycle.

7. Take action based on the reviewed documentation while keeping in mind the collaborators needed to complete the task, you'll want at least three.

## System Viability

Great, the ball's rolling now so let's ask some important questions lest we get carried away by the currents of cosmos. We will do this through the lens of a viable systems model:

1. What is the purpose or identity of our activity?
2. What intelligence is needed about the exterior environment for our group to be effective in carrying out it's activities?
3. How are our operations balancing the tension of stability (upper half) and innovation (lower half)?
4. What task cooridinates our activity?
5. What resources do we need and how do we get them?
