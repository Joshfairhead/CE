# What are tokens?

Tokens are digitally scarce symbols with associated properties. These can generally be thought of as representing either short term mediums of exchange (currency), or as long term stores of value (capital). Initially Swiss regulators made sense of these through a framework of three types; `utility tokens`, `security tokens` and `community tokens`.

### Utility tokens (+)

Utility tokens can be used to redeem functionality within the context of a network and are analogus to vouchers or coupons that enable the bearer to access services - like streaming music and media.

### Security Tokens (-)

Security tokens can be thought of as legal wrappers which denote ownership rights. This could be thought of as shares in a company or the deeds to a property.

### Community Tokens (=)

Community tokens represent a grey zone between access and ownership. let's say your into digital collectibles like pokemon cards, by owning such a card you gain additional benefits like access to a community of similar collectors.
