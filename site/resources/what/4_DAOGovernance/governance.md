# Governance

Governance is the management of shared resources and refers to processes of essential deliberation and existential decision making. We can approximate the dynamics in three forms; `soft governance`, `hard governance` and `meta governance`.

### ðŸ’« Metagovernance (=)

Metagovernance acts as a spontaneous switch to flip decision modality between hard and soft forms of governance. Drawing a comparison to its cousin metaphysics; hard governance can be considered analogous to ðŸ—¿<tip content="knowlege about how we know">epistemology</tip> ðŸ—¿, while soft governance can be considered analogous to ðŸŒ€ <tip content="subjective tastes and preferences of belief systems">ontology</tip> ðŸŒ€.

### ðŸŒ€ Soft Governance (-)

Soft governance is a world of identities, relationships, and potentialities that stoke the fires of will and desire through exchange of cultural values, mission statements and manifestos. Discourse in the deliberative modality where parties offer eachother advice or warnings is typically most civilised.

### ðŸ—¿ Hard Governance (+)

Formalized decision processes that adhere to an agreed upon or dictated set of conventions. These explicit rule sets lend themselves to on chain mechanisims and codification as software tools like [Commonwealth](commonwealth.im)

## ðŸŒ± System Viability

Great - the ball's rolling - let's ask some important questions lest our vessel get carried away by the cosmic currents. Think about and consider the wider context of your activites through the lens of a viable systems model. Consider the relationships as generative links to derrive questions from, below are a limited set of examples:

![Viable Systems Model](/assets/onboarding/ViableSystem.png)

1. What is the aligning source or purpose that drives activity? Pioneers are suggested to query their cosmologies and contemplate essential questions or spiritual callings!
2. What information and intelligence is needed to make sense of trends and horizons in the external world? How does this relate to purpose and guide the coordination task? What resourcing opportuntities are available?
3. What operations support autonomy for everyone in the ecosystem? Is the vibe aligned with purpose? Has operations enough intelligence about the exterior environment? Hows the pipeline for tasks and projects looking? Do they need resourcing?
4. What tasks and projects are cohearing coordination? Do they fit with organisational purpose? Do they fit with the wider environment? Are they sufficiently resourced? What infrastructure is needed to manage activity?
5. What resources are needed to sustain organisational purpose? How are resources acquired? What forms do they take? Are they nutritious and wholesome?

## Beyond
Beyond these fundemental forms there are many other lenses and models that one can look at the subject of governace through.

Functions of governance:
- Vision
- Risk / Compliance
- Performance
- Oversight

Viable systems model:
- Identity
- Intelligence
- Operations
- Democracy
- Tyranny

Modes of Human Assembly:
- Democracy (=)
- Consensus (-)
- Meritocracy (+)

Platos republic:
- Auxillaries: Spirited (=)
- Artisans: Appetive (-)
- Rulers: Logical (+)

Five states or regimes of governance:
- Aristocracy
- Timocracy
- Oligarchy
- Democracy
- Tyranny

A core existential question that applies to decision making is "who decides who decides?" In other words, who is the author of the story and how is this authority legitimate?

[Vitalik proposes six forms of legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html):
- Brute force: if someone is powerful enough to "impose their Will" by making resistance hard.
- Continuity: if a system was legitimate at some point, it will likely continue to be.
- Fairness: if a system satisfies an intuitive notion of fairness.
- Process: if the procedure in place for making decisions is perceived as being legitimate.
- Performance: if a systemâ€™s outputs are considered to satisfy peopleâ€™s needs and expectations.
- Participation: i.e., how many people participated in the systemâ€™s decision-making process.
