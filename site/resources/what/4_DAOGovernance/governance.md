# DAO Governance

Governance is a word which refers to deliberation (essence) and decision making (existence). It's an evergreen topic in autonomously organising spaces like web3, coming in three fundemental forms; `soft governance`, `hard governance` and `meta governance`.

### Meta Governance (=)

Meta governance is the process of reconciling both hard and soft flavours of governance. To analagously on metaphysics, hard governance can be considered synonomous with <tip content="knowlege about knowing">epistemology</tip> (rock), while soft governance can be considered synonomous with <tip content="subjective tastes and preferences of a belief systems">ontology</tip> (whirlpool).

The epistemological process of deciding how decisions should and shouldn't be made represent the hard rock like aspects of metagovernance, while the ontological process of discussing how discussions should and shouln't be run represents the soft whirlpool like aspects.

### Soft Governance (-)

Deliberative discussion around what could, should and shouldn't be done. You can think of it as water cooler chitter chatter. This is often a pleasent way to get started on projects but without harder mechanisms in place the group can get stuck and devolve into argument or simply remain suspended in virtuality by taking no action.

### Hard Governance (+)

Formalized decision processes that adhere to an agreed upon or dictated set of conventions. These processes are often codified as software tools for voting but there are alternative designs that are more progressive in nature. The main thing is that there is some defined criterea for taking action.

## Beyond
Beyond these fundemental forms there are many other lenses and models that one can look at the subject of governace through.

Functions of governance:
- Vision
- Risk / Compliance
- Performance
- Oversight

Viable systems model:
- Identity
- Intelligence
- Operations
- Democracy
- Tyranny

Modes of Human Assembly:
- Democracy (=)
- Consensus (-)
- Meritocracy (+)

Platos republic:
- Auxillaries: Spirited (=)
- Artisans: Appetive (-)
- Rulers: Logical (+)

Five states or regimes of governance:
- Aristocracy
- Timocracy
- Oligarchy
- Democracy
- Tyranny

A core existential question that applies to decision making is "who decides who decides?" In other words, who is the author of the story and how is this authority legitimate?

[Vitalik proposes six forms of legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html):
- Brute force: if someone is powerful enough to "impose their Will" by making resistance hard.
- Continuity: if a system was legitimate at some point, it will likely continue to be.
- Fairness: if a system satisfies an intuitive notion of fairness.
- Process: if the procedure in place for making decisions is perceived as being legitimate.
- Performance: if a system’s outputs are considered to satisfy people’s needs and expectations.
- Participation: i.e., how many people participated in the system’s decision-making process.
