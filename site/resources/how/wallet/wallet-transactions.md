# Wallet Transactions

### Cosmos wallets

Prerequisite: make sure you have installed and setup Keplr wallet.

- Open your Chrome browser and look for the puzzle piece in the top right corner; click it to see the extensions you've installed.
- A drop down menu will appear and within it you'll find "Keplr" as an option; click it to open your wallet.
- Type the password you previously created into Keplr and click "unlock".
- At the top of the Keplr window between the hamburger menu and the icon of a person you'll see a network name; probably "Cosmos hub".
- Click this network name and a drop down menu will appear. Scroll down to find the network you wish to use; for instance if you select "Regen" as your network "Cosmos hub" will now read "Regen" instead.
- Lower down in the Keplr interface you'll see the name you chose for your wallet, below that you'll set of characters which looks something like `regen1pc6x4v4sxlf...05cy3tt4w`; which is your wallet address or `public key`. This always starts with the name of your 'home chain', so in this example it should start with regen.
- Click the text to copy it and you'll see a notification saying "address copied". You can now share this address with others in order for them to interact with you on the network (sign transactions, make exchanges, send tokens etc.). Alternativly you can click the "deposit" button and a QR code will pop up, which others can then scan with a camera to send you a transaction.
- Ask a friend to send you a test transaction of just a few tokens just to make sure everythings working. You can check these have been recieved by opening Keplr and looking at the purple "avalable" tag - this may take a short amount of time to show up. Assuming you see the tokens showing, all is good and you have recieved your first transaction!
- If you have tokens in your wallet you can also send a transaction. In your Keplr wallet interface, you just need to click the "send" button on the home screen. Doing so will open up a screen asking for an address; paste the address you want to send to and choose the amount you wish to transfer, then select "send".
- Celebrate; you've sucessfully overcome the user experience issues of web3! ðŸŽ‰
